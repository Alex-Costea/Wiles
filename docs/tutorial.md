# Tutorial (WIP)

## How to Set Up Wiles

### Method 1: Try It Online

You can experiment with Wiles right now! Just visit [this link](https://wiles.costea.in) and start coding.

### Method 2: Run Without Backend/Frontend

If you only need the core functionality, follow these steps:

1. Compile the `wiles-base` package by running the `compile_base.sh` script.
2. Execute the `main` function inside `wiles.Main`, passing your input file as an argument.

For example, if you're using the `Wiles.jar` file, run:

```sh
java -jar Wiles.jar -file example.wiles
```

Need more options? Use `-help` to see all available commands.

### Method 3: Run Backend and Frontend Locally

If you want the full experience, you can run both the backend and frontend on your machine. Choose one of these methods:

- Run only the backend (which serves a static frontend) by executing `run_dev.sh`,
then open `localhost:8080` in your browser.
- Run both the backend and frontend servers at the same time by also running `npm run dev`,
then open `localhost:3000`.

## Hello World in Wiles

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program:

```wiles
# Print "Hello, world!" to output
write_line("Hello, world!")
```

A few things to note right away:
- No need for a `main` functionâ€”just write your code and go!
- Comments start with `#` and continue until the end of the line.
- Strings are enclosed in `""`.
- Functions are called in `func(args)` format.
- `write_line` prints a string followed by a newline. For no newline, use `write`.
- Statements are separated by newlines. To put multiple statements on one line, use `;`.

## String Formatting

### Multiline Strings

Strings can span multiple lines by default:

```wiles
write_line("This is line 1.
This is line 2.")
```

### Unicode Support

Unicode works out of the box:

```wiles
write_line("ÃŽmi place cÃ¢nd aplicaÈ›iile acceptÄƒ Unicode. ðŸ˜Š")
```

### Escaping Characters

Escaping is forgivingâ€”if something isn't recognized, it just stays as-is. Here are the most common escapes:

- `\n` â†’ Newline
- `\q` â†’ Double quotes `"`
- `\b` â†’ Backslash `\`

Example:

```wiles
write_line("Hello!\nMy name is \qAlex\q. Here's my favorite emoticon: \bo/")
```

Output:

```
Hello!
My name is "Alex". Here's my favorite emoticon: \o/
```

### HTML5-Like Escapes

Wiles supports HTML5-style character escaping, but with `\` instead of `&`:

```wiles
write_line("I owe my friend 100\euro;. I'll send it on Paypal\trade;")
```

Output:

```
I owe my friend â‚¬100. I'll send it on Paypalâ„¢
```

You can also use Unicode character codes:

```wiles
write_line("\#x1F1F7;\#x1F1F4;")
```

Output:

```
ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´
```

## Numbers

### Integers

Just write them as-is:

```wiles
write_line(123)
```

No need to worry about limitsâ€”integers in Wiles internally `BigInteger`, so they can be arbitrarily large:

```wiles
write_line(123456789123456789123456789123456789)
```

For negative numbers, use `-` (which is technically a unary minus operator):

```wiles
write_line(-123)
```

### Rational Numbers

Just use a decimal point:

```wiles
write_line(3.1415)
```

Wiles also supports `Infinity`, which can be negated as usual:

```wiles
write_line(Infinity)
write_line(-Infinity)
```

Under the hood, rational numbers internally use `BigDecimal` in `DECIMAL128` mode.

### Math Operations

Basic arithmetic works like you'd expect:

```wiles
write_line(5 + 3 * 5)  # Outputs 20
```

Use parentheses to control order of operations:

```wiles
write_line((5 + 3) * 5)  # Outputs 40
```

Unary operators (`-` and, if you need it for whatever reason, `+`) work too:

```wiles
write(+10 - -10)  # Outputs 20
```

#### Integer vs Rational Division

Integer division returns an integer result:

```wiles
write_line(4 / 3)  # Outputs 1
```

To get a rational result, make at least one number a decimal:

```wiles
write_line(4 / 3.0)  # Outputs 1.333333333333...
write_line(4.0 / 3)  # Outputs 1.333333333333...
```

#### Exponentiation

Use `^` for exponentiation:

```wiles
write_line(2 ^ 10)  # Outputs 1024
```
